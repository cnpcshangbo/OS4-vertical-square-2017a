# OS4-vertical-square-2017a
This is my project folder to support my YouTube video.

# My updates
## Modified some ploting commands to make it possible to run in MATLAB 2017;
## Made a demo to show how to make the drone fly throught a vertical square path, video can be seen in: https://youtu.be/LWijMJMqVRI

# Future work
## Apply Fractional order controller for this flight simulator;
## Compare different kinds of controllers about certain disterbance;
## Test controller performance on different sampling period.

# To-dos
## Verify all the equations.

# Existing bugs
## Certain parameters make the drone fly away (some variables go too large) which is not reasonable and unexpected. Please leave a message to me in the GitHub Issues if you experience that. I'll try to figure this out.
